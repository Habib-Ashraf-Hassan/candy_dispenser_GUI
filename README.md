# Candy Dispenser
Python GUI app on how to implement  a candy dispenser using a Stack ADT

The app has five buttons representing the 5 operations one can fo with a stack
and a rectangular shaped figure to represent the candy dispenser itself, thin small rectangles entering the dispenser to rep the candies and a gray striped box like shape at the botton to rep a spring, the spring gets compressed on adding more candies and stretches when removing candies out of the dispenser

**Library used:** tkinter

There are two .py files:
- *candy_user_controlled.py*: this app enables user to enter the color of the candy in an entry widget then upon clicking push , this candy gets pushed into the dispenser....the other buttons would work same as for the operations in a stack
- *candy_computer_controlled.py*: here the computer randomly chooses a unique color on clikcing "push" and pushes it to the dispenser, i.e user does not get to decide which color gets to be pushed into the dispenser
